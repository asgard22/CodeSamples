This repository contains examples of code from the class CS 104: Data Structures and Object Oriented Design, taught at the University of Southern California during the Summer 2014 semester.

Each folder contains both header and source code files, including a mix of assignment-specific code, and implementations of data structures that were developed throughout the course. 

The first two are specific assignments from the course. The last folder is a project that was developed throughout the course using Qt. It is intended to be a non-networked, simplified version of a microblog site such as twitter.
